![Least Squares with Polynomial Features Fit using Pure Python without Numpy or Scipy](https://github.com/ThomIves/LeastSquaresPolyFitPurePy/blob/master/Least_Squares_Poly_Logo.png)
> Coverage of least squares modeling in pure python with polynomial expansion inputs without numpy or scipy built up from previous blog posts from https://integratedmlai.com/.

Our goal is to better understand principles of machine learning tools by exploring how to code them ourselves ...

Meaning, we are seeking to code these tools without using the **AWESOME** python modules available for machine learning. 

These efforts **will** provide insights and better understanding. This post stands on the shoulders of the posts before it, and presents a combination of our least squares machine learning tool and our polynomial features tool, each having their own repo and blog posts too.

At one end of the spectrum, if you are new to linear algebra or python or both, I believe that you will find this post helpful among, I hope, a good group of saved links.

At the other end of the spectrum, if you have background with python and linear algebra, your reason to read this post would beÂ to compare how I did it to how you'd do it. The review may give you some new ideas, <em>or it may confirm that you still like your way better.
